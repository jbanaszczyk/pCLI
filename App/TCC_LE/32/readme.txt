TCC/LE  Overview
----------------

  TCC/LE is a free (but unsupported) version of TCC (Take Command Console)
  included in our flagship product Take Command.  Although TCC/LE is not 
  as powerful as TCC (see the topic "TCC vs. TCC/LE" in the help file for
  a feature comparison), it is still compatible with CMD.EXE (the default 
  Windows command processor), while adding thousands of additional features.


Installation Notes
------------------

   TCC/LE is distributed as a Windows Installer file.  Just run TCCLE.EXE
   to install.
