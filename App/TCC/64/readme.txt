This file contains a variety of information you should read before using
TCC, including:

New Version Overview
--------------------
 
  TCC version 28 is the character-mode command processor from our flagship
  product Take Command. TCC includes the IDE / batch debugger, but does not
  include the Take Command tabbed console interface or the integrated
  Windows file explorer.

Installation Notes
------------------

   Our products are distributed as Windows Installer files which install
   the product when run.

Trial Version Basics
--------------------

   We distribute trial or "shareware" versions of our software to allow you
   to "try before you buy". Most users obtain trial versions by downloading
   them. You might also have one if a friend gave you a copy of their
   software -- as long as they don't give you their registration key (which 
   would be illegal), the software they gave you will operate as a trial 
   version.
 
   We explain here how trial versions work because we believe that full
   disclosure of what you can expect from your software is the best policy
   for both you and us. Our timing mechanism is designed to give you a
   fair opportunity to try our software, order it, and receive it without
   significant restrictions on use. It's also designed to make sure that
   use of the software becomes restricted if you exceed the normal
   evaluation period.
   
   Trial versions of our products are fully functional evaluation copies
   which are not "crippled" or feature-limited in any way except for the
   trial timing mechanism described here.

   TCC gives you a 30-day evaluation period. The number of days remaining
   in the evaluation period is displayed when you start the program, and
   can be redisplayed at any time with the VER /R command.

Registering Your Copy
---------------------

   When you purchase a new or upgrade copy of TCC, you will receive an
   email with your registration key. Start TCC, run the OPTION command,
   and select the "Register" tab. Enter the registration information 
   exactly as you received it in the email.

   Remember to save your registration key in a safe place in case you need
   to reinstall TCC. If you have lost your registration key, you can
   request a replacement by contacting JP Software at support@jpsoft.com.
