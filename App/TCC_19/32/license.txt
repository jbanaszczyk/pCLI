SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT AND LIMITED WARRANTY for Trial and Registered 
Copies

If you don't agree with the terms below, you should not use or evaluate
this Software.

In this agreement:

   "Software" means the JP Software product(s) you have obtained for 
   evaluation or purchased, including the software, documentation, and 
   other materials;

   "Trial Copy" means a copy of the Software for which you have not paid
   a fee to us or one of our authorized dealers (Trial Copies are typically 
   described as "trial" copies in the Software's sign-on messages);

   "Registered Copy" means a copy of the Software for which you have paid 
   a fee to us or to one of our authorized dealers, and which is not 
   described as a trial copy in the Program's sign-on messages;

   "We" or "us" means JP Software Inc., a corporation based in Chestertown,
   Maryland, USA;

   "You" means the evaluator or end user of the Software;

(1) Legal Agreement.  This legal agreement allows you to use the Software 
under the terms and conditions below.

(2) Ownership.  We or our licensors own the Software under copyright, trade
secret and all other laws that may apply.  All JP Software product names, 
designs, and logos are trademarks of JP Software Inc.

(3) Evaluation Period.  You may use a Trial Copy of the Software for an 
evaluation period of up to 30 days, in order to determine whether the 
Software meets your needs before purchasing a license.  Your evaluation 
period begins when you first install the Software on one or more computers
for evaluation purposes.  Once the evaluation period ends, you agree to 
either purchase a license for the Software, or to stop using it.  If you 
have ordered a Purchased Copy of the Software from us or from one of our
authorized dealers you may continue to use your Trial Copy until your 
Purchased Copy arrives.

(4) Use of the Trial Software.  While you are evaluating the Software, 
you may use it on as many computers as are required to perform your 
evaluation.  However, once the evaluation period is over and you purchase 
a license for the Software, your use will be restricted to the number of 
computers for which you have purchased licenses, under the license 
agreement which applies to your Registered Copy.

(5) Making and Distributing Trial Copies of the Software.  You may make 
copies of your Trial Copy of the Software to give to others, as long as 
you include all of the files that you originally received with your Trial
Copy.  You agree not to sell Trial Copies of the Software or distribute 
them to others for any kind of compensation or fee.

(6) Use of Individual Copies. If you purchased an individual copy of the
Software it may be installed for a single person's use on up to three 
Computers (such as a Computer at work, a Computer at home, and a portable
Computer), as long as all Computers are primarily for that person's use 
at all times, and they are never used simultaneously except during active 
transfer of files between them. (If the Software copy was purchased by 
your employer, you must obtain your employer's explicit permission before 
installing the Software on multiple Computers as described above.)

(7) Multi-System Licenses.  If you purchased a multi-system (rather than 
individual) license for the Software, you may install the Software on at 
most the number of Computers licensed, as shown on the program signon screen
or authorized in other electronic or printed documents received from us or 
our dealer.  Unlike individual copies, under a multi-system license each 
Computer (work, home, portable, etc.) is counted separately, even if the 
Computers are not in use simultaneously.

(8) Copying and Distribution of Registered Copies.  You may copy the 
Software files as necessary for normal backup purposes.  In addition, you 
may give the trial version of the Software to individual friends and 
colleagues you know personally, without your serial number or registration 
keys.  You may not make, sell, or give to others, any other whole or 
partial copy of the Software, without our advance written permission.

(9) Registration Keys.  Any registration keys you receive in order to 
personalize, install, or register  the software are private and confidential 
information known only to you and to us, and may not be given to others 
under any circumstances.

(10) LIMITED WARRANTY.  We don't promise that the Software will be free of
software bugs or program errors.  If  you report an error or bug to us, we
will address it as part of our normal maintenance procedures.  If we issue
a maintenance release for the Software containing a correction for an error
you reported, we will make a copy of that release available to you for 
electronic download at no charge.  We will only do this for maintenance 
releases, not for other new versions of the Software.

(11) Satisfaction Guarantee.  If you are dissatisfied with any JP Software 
product you buy from us under this Agreement for any reason, you may return 
it to us at any time up to 90 days after purchase and we will refund the 
amount you paid.  You must contact us before returning any product for a 
refund.  This satisfaction guarantee does not apply to multi-system licenses 
for more than 10 Computers, or to purchases of more than 10 individual copies.

(12) DISCLAIMERS, LIMITATIONS, and RESTRICTED RIGHTS.

  SOFTWARE AND DATA.

  YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SELECTION AND USE OF THE SOFTWARE 
  TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU USE IT 
  IMPROPERLY OR AGAINST OUR INSTRUCTIONS YOU CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR FILES,
  SOFTWARE AND DATA.  The Limited Warranty above gives you specific legal 
  rights, but you may have other rights, which vary from jurisdiction to 
  jurisdiction.

  >> HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.  THE SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT 
  DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED OR INTENDED FOR USE AS ONLINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT

  systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons 
  systems, or any other environment in which the failure of the Software 
  could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or 
  environmental damage ("High Risk Activities").  WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM
  ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES FOR
  THE SOFTWARE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF.

  >> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:  IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY 
  INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT 
  OF USE OF THE PROGRAM OR YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US.  Some jurisdictions
  do not allow exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or 
  consequential damages, therefore the above limitation may not apply to you.

  >> EXPORT.  You may use the Software in any country, except countries that
  are subject to U.S. export restrictions.  You are solely responsible for 
  determining whether any planned export relating to the Software is legal 
  under U.S. and other applicable laws.
